Title: Multi-class Classification of Internet Firewall Data: A Comparative Study

Abstract: 
The analysis of firewall logs plays an important role in monitoring network traffic and making informed decisions about allowing or blocking specific traffic. It plays a significant role in evaluating the impact of network activity. Our study focuses on analyzing firewall logs by building multi-class machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models that are capable of classifying the incoming traffic into four distinct classes- "Allow, " "Drop, " "Deny, " or "Reset-both". Several ML and DL algorithms were used for evaluation , including, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Logistic Regression (LR) and k-Means Clustering. After our analysis, Random Forest was found to be the most effective algorithm for classifying the internet firewall data.
